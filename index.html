    <p>Cats are cute. Dogs are cool too. I don't know what to write.</p>
    <p>Roses are red. Violets are blue. Poems suck.</p>
    <p>I like candles and scented lotions and dope ass Apex skins. That is'nt a poem but it came from the heart.</p>
    <p>My tummy was upset this morning and I pooped my pants. I feel better now.</p>
