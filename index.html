    <p>I'm not really sure what to put here. I'm more curious to see how this works.</p>
    <p>This is a long trip and my husbands driving scares me. Learning to code just to pass some time.</p>
    <p>I can't wait to get home so I can play some Apex.</p>
    <p>We still have about 4 and a half hours left of this trip.</p>
